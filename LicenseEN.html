<p><strong>&sect; 4 Warranty/ liability for Software defects</strong></p>
<p>According to the recognized state of the art, it is not possible to develop complex Software products that are
    completely free of errors and work error-free at all times in all applications and combinations, in particular with
    different hardware components The agreed quality of the Software provided by the licensor is therefore not designed
    to ensure that no program errors may occur or that the Software can be used for every conceivable application, but
    only that the Software has no program errors that more than insignificantly impair the intended usability. The
    Licensor shall be liable for ensuring that the Software complies with the service description.</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Licensor shall endeavour to maintain the contractually agreed quality of the Software during the term of the
        contract.</li>
    <li>The licensor will offer the Licensee improvements or new update versions free of charge during the rental
        contract. The number, time and content of the updates are at the discretion of the licensor.</li>
    <li>Support is available Monday through Friday from 2:30 PM to 7:30 PM (Timezone: GMT+1), except Sundays and
        holidays. Due to the many updates, support can only be provided for the latest version of the Software.</li>
    <li>The Licensor must remedy any defects of quality and title of the Software within a reasonable period of time.
    </li>
    <li>Not included in the scope of the contract is the elimination of malfunctions or damage due to improper handling
        or other external influences for which the licensor is not responsible. Services provided by the Licensor to
        eliminate such disturbances will be invoiced separately at the prices valid at the time. Interventions in the
        Software or in the data managed by the Software, by the Licensee or third parties, are prohibited and release
        the Licensor from the obligations of this Agreement.</li>
    <li>The Licensee is obliged to notify the licensor in writing of any defects of the Software immediately after their
        discovery. In the case of quality defects, this shall be done with a description of the time of occurrence of

                the damage is due to gross negligence or intent on the part of the Licensor or his agents. The liability
                of the licensor is limited to the purchase price of the Software. The Licensor shall not be liable for
                any further claims of the Licensee, in particular claims for damages including loss of profit or other
                financial losses of the Licensee.</li>

                together with Software and hardware existing at the Licensee.</li>
            <li>The liability of the licensor in the event of use by the Licensee in breach of contract is excluded.
            </li>
            <li>The Licensor shall not be liable for damages if and insofar as the Licensee could have prevented their
                occurrence by reasonable precautions - in particular program and data backup.</li>
